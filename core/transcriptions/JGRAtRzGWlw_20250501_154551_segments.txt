17.00-18.42: THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL
21.45-23.73: — Today's the last day of school
23.89-25.48: — And then it's free time!
26.61-28.35: — Too early to celebrate, parasite!
28.43-41.66: Have you even seen your grades?
You're on the edge of failing every single subject at school.
So if you manage to get at least one bad mark today,
you'll be left for summer school,
and besides that - I'll kick your with this broom,
having it wound with a barbed wire,
poured over with gasoline and put on fire.
41.97-44.39: — Got that, son?!
46.23-47.21: ... Yes mom
47.38-48.62: — Splendid then :)
49.90-52.92: — I need to come up with a plan, fast!
57.06-58.61: — Eureka, bitch!
64.64-65.69: — MOOOOOOOOOM!
67.34-79.03: — So you say the floor is slippery?
— Yeah, got my head hurt. mom, maybe i should stay home today?
— Nonsense, you'll go
— But my head hurts
— Nonsense, eat yo breakfast and go
79.14-81.18: — But i lost 0.79 gallons of blood
82.56-83.68: — ok, mom
86.14-89.98: — Alright, let's settle it like wise people - like a men
90.46-102.19: — You know for good, that if i go to school today,
i'll fail for sure, but if i stay at home - nothing will happen.
Ain't that right?
120.58-122.48: Hmmm... It was kinda tasty
132.87-137.81: (Damn, i'll need to watch out and lay down for the whole day.
I wonder if we had any homework for today?)
137.97-142.66: — Time to check homework
— Fffuuuuuuuuu
— And the respondent will be...
142.75-147.74: (Please, not me! Anyone else - women, children, beavers,
but not me! PLz PLZ plZ...)
149.88-151.84: — Hellknows, you'll be answering
151.96-153.65: — just one minute
153.87-157.24: FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDGE!!!!!!!
157.35-158.32: — what's the topic?
158.39-159.77: Pearl Harbor
160.21-162.36: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUDGE!!!!!!!
162.38-165.61: hey, wait a minute
166.65-172.81: Year 1941! On 7-th december in the morning japs commit
a smartass-attack on the Military base "Pearl Harbor"
173.01-184.32: — Sleepy americans try to confront them in their
pants and socks for a shitload of hours.
Everything explodes on the location,
fried organs fly in the air.
Visibility is lost in fountains of blood
and  redness from getting pwned
184.36-185.54: Attack is a success!
185.61-187.31: Bunker get's wiped the fuck out!
187.41-188.10: This is madness!
188.12-188.91: This is sparta!
188.93-189.74: When is the new cartoon?!
189.81-190.64: The forces are getting tired
190.66-191.67: Holy sheet!
191.77-192.95: (I don't know how translate it! :)
193.00-194.74: Do a headshot!
194.82-199.37: When i was young we shot with forks,
because there were no rifles back then
199.51-201.43: — Well, that was kinda right
201.74-205.04: — And then I run out and start shoting
those mother-F-ers with a minigun
205.09-208.84: — What the? Are you describing me the gameplay
from "medal of honor - pacific assault"?
208.91-212.71: — Ehm... no, that was just a quote
from one of the soldiers, ok?
213.00-216.26: — Ok, you get a "4"
(or a "B" if you are from America)
216.37-217.29: — YES
221.26-226.40: Alright, who wants to answer the retelling
of the novel "Crime and Punishment"? Maybe you, Dima?
226.69-228.60: — Nah, I don't want to.
228.65-229.91: — Oh, but I know you want to.
229.96-231.90: — It a surprise that you are able to know anything.
231.90-233.40: — Come on, get over here
233.49-234.61: — Naaaaahh
234.61-235.94: — Then you get an "F"
(or "1" if you are not american... Fuck you!)
236.18-240.03: *goddamnyoudumbwhore* alright, I'll do it
240.13-249.53: — What's the big idea setting me up, woman?
Why haven't you raised your hand?
I know you've read it, I know everything about you,
even where you live
254.32-255.75: — You cry like a sissy
257.37-261.06: — So, what's with the silence?
— I'm preparing
261.27-269.73: OMG, panic! I haven't red anything, not even a shortened content.
what should i do now!? Shiiit. well, I'll try using
some good old fashion logic, let the force be with me, always
269.92-276.05: The main idea of the given literature tells us, that every
evil deed involves an inevitable punishment...
276.12-280.67: ... on which basis
It is possible to draw a conclusion that absence
of malicious acts will prevent any punishment...
280.82-285.01: ... However, what is an evil deed? After all,
everyone has it's own system of estimation...
285.23-288.33: Something unacceptable for one can be normal to the other.
288.47-292.61: Thus - punishments are unfair, and a movie
called "the last airbender" sucks balls
295.81-299.76: — But what about the main content! When the guy
owns the old lady with an axe and all that stuff?
299.90-306.46: — What!? how dare you? how can you discuss
  this story so superficially?
— But it's a novel, not a story
— Ehm, that's not important
306.59-311.99: ... It is the greatest literature in the world.
People who neglect it should have their limbs ripped off
312.08-316.08: — I haven't thought that you'd like the novel so much.
I guess you really have read it...
316.39-318.91: ... Good for you, it made you think ...
319.11-320.37: ... You get a "5" ("A")
320.63-321.89: — May I be excused?
322.04-323.54: — Yes, of course
326.54-337.11: — YEEEAH, HELL YEAH, FUCK YEEAAH! WHo's got big balls!?
I've got big balls!!
I GOT A FIVE, BWAHAHAH!!!
339.84-342.82: — Hell yes, I'm kicking it! Everything's
going to go well from now on, probably.
342.92-345.94: Dima, name me all kinds of spirits for a mark.
357.66-359.70: — Hey man, can you help me out here, ok?
359.87-362.46: — Nononono, I'm just filming a cartoon here
362.63-363.83: — Well, maybe you'll help me out?
363.89-365.90: — Well, I'll do my best
366.04-368.54: — Thanks dude! You is da man
369.99-373.51: — Hey, will you help me help him

411.96-413.27: — Go on, go on
413.32-414.68: — Ehm, that's all
414.77-419.60: — That's all? Good boy! It was a little screwy,
but you can sit down, four! ("B")
420.03-422.72: — Fuck yeaah!
425.09-427.80: — Hellknows, take your report and get the F outta here!!
427.92-429.23: — With pleasure!!!
434.80-435.79: — I'm home...
436.74-440.20: — I didn't get any bad marks today,
that's why everything should be peachy keen
440.40-442.60: — Have you even seen your grades?
442.67-444.48: — Emmm, no
444.54-446.06: — Then look
446.50-449.27: — I don't have, even a single "3" ("c")?
449.65-451.62: — But you told me this morning that..
451.68-454.12: — Yes, I lied. But nothing went wrong, didn't it?
454.10-459.89: ...On the contrary, you got more than you expected.
If I hadn't frightened you, you would even
think of trying harder, would you?
460.13-461.83: — Well, probably
462.10-465.24: — That's right! You're gonna thank me later,
when you'll ba entering university...
465.37-467.96: ... Cuz every deed that you do will have consequenses in the future
468.10-469.02: — Realy?
469.17-472.12: — No, damn it, I'm making up stuff! Yes, realy!
472.39-476.94: — It was important to show you this.
It's up to you to decide how to live further.
484.01-489.83: — Hello, classmate. I just wanted to say that I'm soryy
for being such a jackass all the time and for annoyng you...
490.00-493.51: ... I just wanted you to know, that I actually
always aknowledged you as a person
493.61-497.65: ... So please don't be mad at me, and I hope that we will be friends
498.55-500.90: — Thank you, that means a lot for me.

503.53-504.91: — Yeah, goodbye
507.68-516.23: — It worked, a pair of sweet pathos phrases and i got her trust.
