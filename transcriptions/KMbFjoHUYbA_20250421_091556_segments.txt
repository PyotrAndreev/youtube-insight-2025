0.08-3.36: if you don't want to be like everyone
1.88-5.76: else then you have to make the
3.36-7.52: sacrifices others aren't willing to make
5.76-10.00: that's what my mentor told me when I was
7.52-12.04: in my early 20s and it stuck with me
10.00-14.00: ever since I started out with no
12.04-16.20: qualifications and no money but still
14.00-18.08: managed to become a multi-millionaire
16.20-19.76: and a big part of that was down to
18.08-21.56: avoiding the seven things I'm going to
19.76-24.32: be sharing with you today the first
21.56-26.08: thing to avoid is working for only money
24.32-28.68: imagine for a moment that you got a
26.08-30.64: boring but well-paid job you quickly
28.68-32.72: start stacking some nice cash as your
30.64-34.56: earnings grow your friends will think
32.72-36.36: that you're absolutely killing it and
34.56-39.48: your parents will probably be pretty
36.36-42.60: proud too however over time your earning
39.48-45.72: potential would start to Plateau this is
42.60-48.48: path a now imagine instead you get a
45.72-50.16: challenging but lower pay job you might
48.48-52.88: struggle for a couple of years as you
50.16-54.72: improve and adapt you may even struggle
52.88-56.40: to pay the bills your friends will
54.72-58.36: probably think you're falling behind and
56.40-61.40: your parents may not agree with the path
58.36-63.20: you've taken however over time your
61.40-67.40: earning potential will start going
63.20-69.24: through the Ruth this is path B so
67.40-72.68: what's the difference between these two
69.24-76.48: examples well path a prioritizes money
72.68-79.60: early on whereas path B prioritizes two
76.48-81.44: key things skills and Equity every
79.60-83.96: self-made millionaire I know has
81.44-86.20: followed path b as it's the only way to
83.96-88.40: build that kind of wealth as I mentioned
86.20-90.60: I left school at 16 with no
88.40-92.36: qualifications however I immediately
90.60-95.00: went out looking for jobs and actually
92.36-97.92: got offered more than five opportunities
95.00-100.56: so I had a big decision to make which
97.92-102.96: should I choose I decided to become a
100.56-105.12: carpenter's Apprentice the pay wasn't
102.96-107.24: great but I knew the skills I'd learn
105.12-110.00: would be extremely valuable so I
107.24-111.96: prioritized those there was no way I was
110.00-113.56: going to get equity in the business but
111.96-116.12: at least I was working for more than
113.56-117.84: just money that job taught me a lot and
116.12-119.88: although I was forced to quit after
117.84-122.12: being relentlessly bullied by my manager
119.88-124.08: manager I still use many of those skills
122.12-126.24: today when I'm designing my bestselling
124.08-128.84: brand of radio controled planes that I
126.24-131.28: sell across the world by learning a wide
128.84-133.44: range of high income skills it makes it
131.28-136.32: almost impossible for you to ever be
133.44-138.72: broke again as you become your greatest
136.32-141.00: asset I like to think every job I had
138.72-143.88: when I was younger added to my skill set
141.00-146.24: like a Swiss army knife nowadays I'd
143.88-149.00: recommend prioritizing online based High
146.24-151.36: income skills such as copywriting video
149.00-153.88: editing and cod in the demand for these
151.36-155.96: skills is only growing and I can speak
153.88-158.20: from experience that there is a huge
155.96-160.36: skill shortage at the moment sure there
158.20-163.24: are lots of people doing those things
160.36-165.92: however 99% of them are just not up to
163.24-168.12: standard honestly your competition
165.92-170.96: really isn't that tough now let's move
168.12-173.20: on to the second thing Equity this just
170.96-175.72: means owning a percentage of a business
173.20-177.96: so you can benefit from the profits my
175.72-180.44: radar control model brand is a perfect
177.96-182.72: example of this you can gain equity in a
180.44-184.72: few different ways the most obvious way
182.72-187.00: and the way I did it was to start the
184.72-188.76: business myself however you can also
187.00-191.16: gain it by working for it if you're
188.76-194.16: extremely skilled in certain areas this
191.16-196.56: is known as Sweat Equity lastly you can
194.16-198.60: purchase equity in certain businesses
196.56-200.40: although I wouldn't recommend this as
198.60-202.88: much unless you have the skills that can
200.40-205.40: help accelerate that business forward my
202.88-207.72: friend Simon squib often goes around in
205.40-210.20: public telling people to start their own
207.72-212.24: businesses or ask for equity from their
210.20-213.84: boss while I 100% agree with the
212.24-216.24: sentiment you need to have some
213.84-218.40: self-awareness with this firstly it's
216.24-220.52: worthwhile working for someone to gain
218.40-223.00: skills before starting a business of
220.52-225.20: your own secondly you need to be
223.00-227.12: realistic I didn't think for a moment
225.20-229.52: that I'd get equity in the carpentry
227.12-231.84: business when I was an apprentice so
229.52-233.96: when you ask make sure you have a solid
231.84-235.80: case for why you deserve it and how you
233.96-237.92: can add value to the business instead of
235.80-240.12: just taking from it you need to First
237.92-242.20: focus on becoming someone Worthy of
240.12-244.40: equity the main takeaway here is that
242.20-246.44: too many people get blinded by money
244.40-249.48: forgetting the importance of skills and
246.44-251.80: Equity this is the biggest trap the more
249.48-253.92: you obsess over earning just money the
251.80-256.56: less you'll likely make in the long run
253.92-258.72: the second thing to avoid is buying a
256.56-260.48: luxury lifestyle picture yourself
258.72-262.88: cruising through Dubai sundrenched
260.48-265.20: streets in a bright yellow Lamborghini
262.88-268.60: you pull up to a Swanky restaurant and
265.20-270.60: order a $500 fet steak without batting
268.60-272.60: an eyelid how does do imagining that
270.60-275.72: lifestyle make you feel pretty
272.60-278.20: successful right well here's the truth
275.72-280.32: most people you see living this way are
278.20-282.68: far from successful the majority are
280.32-284.60: paying for cars they can't afford taking
282.68-287.08: trips to Dubai on credit cards they'll
284.60-289.24: spend 5 months paying off and ordering
287.08-291.76: Stakes at Salt Bay restaurant that leave
289.24-294.12: them with a bill they can't handle these
291.76-296.48: people are living a lie pretending to be
294.12-298.96: rich while drowning in death it's all
296.48-300.80: smoke and mirrors as it's much easier to
298.96-302.88: impress others on social media than
300.80-305.00: build real wealth seeing people live
302.88-307.72: these luxury Lifestyles might tempt you
305.00-309.64: to start playing the flexing game too as
307.72-311.96: you feel like everyone is living a
309.64-315.20: better life than you however this is far
311.96-317.32: from the reality in fact 37% of
315.20-318.76: Americans can't afford unexpected
317.32-322.28: expenses over
318.76-325.20: $400 39% worry they can't pay their
322.28-326.84: bills and 60% of American households
325.20-328.92: can't afford to buy a new car once
326.84-330.16: you've made your Millions you can buy
328.92-332.76: whatever you want
330.16-334.96: that's the point of becoming wealthy
332.76-336.96: however in the early days you can't live
334.96-339.44: like a king and build wealth at the same
336.96-342.16: time instead of buying depreciating
339.44-344.64: items like flashy cars designer clothes
342.16-347.32: and dining in expensive restaurants
344.64-349.76: invest in assets such as stocks shares
347.32-351.72: crypto and real estate these assets will
349.76-353.52: increase in value and generate income
351.72-355.88: that you can then use to do whatever you
353.52-358.12: want the third thing to avoid is doing
355.88-360.16: everything yourself you might be really
358.12-362.48: great at what you do but no matter how
360.16-364.24: hard you try you'll never be able to out
362.48-366.24: compete a group of talented people
364.24-368.52: working together look at anyone who's
366.24-371.28: made it big in sports or business if you
368.52-374.08: do some digging you'll see they all had
371.28-376.04: help let's take Elon Musk as an example
374.08-378.36: on the surface it might appear like he's
376.04-379.48: a genius entrepreneur who's achieved
378.36-381.56: everything
379.48-383.44: single-handedly however that couldn't be
381.56-385.80: further from the truth he was part of
383.44-389.80: the group that launched PayPal when eBay
385.80-392.00: acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002
389.80-394.12: these newly wealthy Tech experts spread
392.00-396.36: across the industry like a virus now
394.12-398.80: they're known as the PayPal Mafia as
396.36-401.32: they've become such a powerful Group
398.80-403.60: after leaving PayPal they started many
401.32-406.32: successful companies these include big
403.60-409.00: names like YouTube Yelp LinkedIn and
406.32-411.20: SpaceX they often invest in each other's
409.00-412.92: projects and give advice but what if
411.20-415.08: you're not aiming to launch the next
412.92-416.72: billion dollar company and instead just
415.08-419.56: want to earn some extra money with a
416.72-421.72: side hustle well a lot of older business
419.56-423.60: owners are kind of lost when it comes to
421.72-425.32: everything tech-based and using the
423.60-426.64: internet for their companies I mean a
425.32-429.04: lot of them don't even know there's
426.64-431.04: online tools for literally everything
429.04-433.40: whether it's managing your team handling
431.04-435.64: invoices keeping track of projects or
433.40-437.76: even building a website I don't blame
435.64-439.68: them as back in the day we didn't have
437.76-442.24: any of these things but now the younger
439.68-444.04: generation has a real Advantage so if
442.24-446.76: these older business owners don't know
444.04-448.92: how to do a lot of this online stuff and
446.76-452.00: they understand they can't do everything
448.92-453.56: themselves guess who they need you you
452.00-456.28: can help them bring their businesses
453.56-458.48: into the 21st century and make a lot of
456.28-460.32: money in the process it's all well and
458.48-462.28: good saying this but how could you
460.32-464.28: actually do it well if you want to give
462.28-466.96: this a try then I'd recommend using an
464.28-468.68: all-in-one management platform ODU is a
466.96-470.80: great choice as it includes the tools I
468.68-472.80: just mentioned and more all in one place
470.80-474.92: here's a great example of a website that
472.80-477.28: needs a proper update it looks like it
474.92-479.68: was built over 10 years ago let's jump
477.28-481.80: on Odo and make something a bit more up
479.68-484.72: to date so I'm going to go over here and
481.80-487.24: select the eCommerce app option now
484.72-491.00: let's fill this in I want a Business
487.24-493.40: website there we go and I want for my
491.00-495.20: gardening business after this I've got
493.40-497.04: the option to choose my color palette
495.20-499.20: here but instead I'm just going to add
497.04-501.72: their logo so that ODU just builds a
499.20-504.08: palette based on their brand colors now
501.72-507.24: we've got to pick a theme all these look
504.08-509.00: pretty good so let's go with this one I
507.24-511.12: can use the drag and drop feature to
509.00-513.60: easily edit the page and customize
511.12-515.88: images they also have this cool AI tool
513.60-517.84: to help me out with words let's fast
515.88-521.20: forward about 30 minutes and I'll have
517.84-524.04: something pretty cool to show
521.20-526.24: you check this out it's way better than
524.04-528.36: the old website in my opinion you could
526.24-530.00: make some serious cash helping out older
528.36-532.32: business owners with all the different
530.00-534.36: apps on ODU or even use it to manage
532.32-536.00: your own business I reached out to ODU
534.36-538.52: to see if they wanted to sponsor this
536.00-540.48: portion of the video they agreed and are
538.52-543.04: also giving you your first application
540.48-545.40: free for life with unlimited support and
543.04-547.64: hosting and the cherry on top ODU offers
545.40-549.20: a personalized domain name for one year
547.64-551.00: so if you want to give this a try then
549.20-553.20: check out the link in the description
551.00-555.44: the fourth thing to avoid is having too
553.20-557.56: many inputs do you ever feel like you're
555.44-560.00: being pulled in a million different
557.56-562.24: directions this happens with everything
560.00-564.40: in life from side hustles to Fitness
562.24-566.20: training everyone seems to have a
564.40-568.96: different opinion on what you should be
566.20-569.96: focusing on it can look a little bit
568.96-573.20: like this
569.96-574.88: this is you and these are the people
573.20-576.92: telling you what they think you should
574.88-580.32: be focusing on for the sake of
576.92-582.36: Simplicity let's just call them inputs
580.32-585.04: all these inputs create hundreds of
582.36-588.32: paths you could follow like becoming a
585.04-591.88: doctor entrepreneur joining the family
588.32-594.96: business getting a stable 9-to-5 job
591.88-598.40: traveling and having a family let's call
594.96-600.00: these your potential paths the sheer
598.40-602.00: number of these paths Pathways can
600.00-603.96: create something called cognitive
602.00-606.20: overload which is where your brain
603.96-609.52: simply can't cope with the overwhelming
606.20-611.92: amount of information and choices so
609.52-614.40: what's the solution well I've always
611.92-616.84: started with my end destination in mind
614.40-618.60: and worked backwards of course I didn't
616.84-621.80: know exactly what I wanted to do in the
618.60-624.04: future however I had a decent idea I
621.80-626.04: then made sure to only listen to inputs
624.04-628.36: that help me reach those targets the
626.04-630.48: clearer your goal the easier it becomes
628.36-632.40: to select the right inputs to help you
630.48-634.84: achieve it so limit the number of
632.40-637.84: opinions you receive and prioritize
634.84-639.56: quality over quantity most people have
637.84-642.16: too many opinions being thrown at them
639.56-645.52: but not from experts cut out General
642.16-647.32: opinions and instead seek expert advice
645.52-649.32: this could come from a mentor someone
647.32-651.44: successful in your field or even
649.32-654.08: educational videos from experts like
651.44-656.72: myself by doing this you'll get more
654.08-658.92: valuable focused and specific guidance
656.72-660.76: for your end goal remember even when you
658.92-663.04: work Your Way backwards you still don't
660.76-664.96: need to know everything at once fully
663.04-666.92: listen and Implement what you learn from
664.96-669.16: an input and then when you're facing
666.92-671.24: another challenge you can seek out more
669.16-673.24: inputs that'll help you overcome it if
671.24-675.16: you don't do this then you'll get mental
673.24-677.56: fatigue which can lead to decision
675.16-680.44: paralysis where you find yourself unable
677.56-682.44: to take action or move forward some
680.44-685.36: people might even mistake this for being
682.44-687.88: lazy but in reality your brain just gets
685.36-690.88: overwhelmed the fifth thing to avoid is
687.88-693.28: being ego driven let me start by saying
690.88-695.44: this arrogant people won't even finish
693.28-697.96: this video they think they already know
695.44-700.36: everything so why bother sticking around
697.96-702.40: but that's exactly the problem arrogance
700.36-704.40: blinds you to the opportunities that
702.40-706.76: could genuinely change your life
704.40-709.08: ego-driven people are often too focused
706.76-711.24: on the big picture constantly dreaming
709.08-713.84: of the end goal this might sound
711.24-715.96: productive but it's a dangerous trap
713.84-718.52: when you're always looking too far ahead
715.96-720.48: you end up overlooking the small but
718.52-722.24: crucial step steps that lead to True
720.48-723.96: success for example some might be
722.24-726.12: tempted to scroll through this video
723.96-728.52: just to see all seven things rather than
726.12-731.20: sitting down and actually absorbing the
728.52-733.28: knowledge in each one but by doing so
731.20-735.28: they miss out on the valuable insights
733.28-737.84: that could Fast Track their Journey when
735.28-739.76: you're too egotistical you start to
737.84-741.84: believe that you don't need advice from
739.76-744.12: others especially those who might know
741.84-746.00: more than you you might dismiss the
744.12-748.04: wisdom of people who have already walked
746.00-750.48: the path that you're trying to take but
748.04-752.68: here's the truth true wealth isn't just
750.48-755.12: about being confident it's about having
752.68-756.76: the humility to keep learning to
755.12-758.76: understand that you don't know it all
756.76-760.88: and that's where the real growth happens
758.76-762.92: the more you learn the more you realize
760.88-765.72: how much you don't know this is called
762.92-768.16: the iceberg principle what you know is
765.72-769.84: just the tip of the iceberg the massive
768.16-772.48: chunk of knowledge is underneath the
769.84-774.28: surface that's what truly matters and
772.48-777.20: arrogance makes you forget that it's
774.28-779.68: even there in short arrogance is a
777.20-781.72: silent wealth killer it convin es you
779.68-783.92: that you're too good to learn too smart
781.72-786.20: to listen and too important to take the
783.92-788.40: small steps that lead to Greatness the
786.20-790.36: sixth thing to avoid is passing the
788.40-793.04: blame one of my favorite Chinese
790.36-795.48: Proverbs is the man who blames others
793.04-798.44: has a long way on his journey to go the
795.48-800.84: man who blames himself is halfway there
798.44-803.16: the man who blames no one has already
800.84-806.36: arrived in front of me I have two
803.16-808.04: objects a magnifying glass and a mirror
806.36-810.48: in life you're going to have to choose
808.04-812.96: to reach for either of these on a daily
810.48-815.68: basis you might be thinking Mark's gone
812.96-817.56: mad but let me explain if you choose to
815.68-819.96: pick up the magnifying glass it gives
817.56-823.04: you the ability to hyperfocus on other
819.96-825.60: people this is a dangerous path as it
823.04-827.64: leads to the blame game look I do kind
825.60-829.48: of get it when anything goes wrong in
827.64-831.88: life it's natural to want to pass the
829.48-833.60: blame on to someone else anyone but
831.88-835.28: yourself I'm sure there's been times
833.60-837.48: when you've blamed your teacher for a
835.28-839.80: test you failed even though you spent
837.48-842.40: more time Bing watching n and actually
839.80-844.76: studying or maybe you pass the blame on
842.40-846.60: to the traffic for being late even
844.76-848.24: though you left the house 10 minutes
846.60-850.68: later than you should have but here's
848.24-853.20: the thing these small instances of blame
850.68-855.28: don't stay small over time they grow
853.20-857.60: into a habit that's hard to break free
855.28-859.68: from I'm sure you've seen people say
857.60-861.80: stuff like the government hates young
859.68-864.96: people the system is rigged against
861.80-867.24: people like me my boss doesn't like me
864.96-869.56: I'm not rich enough to start a business
867.24-871.68: and life didn't give me the right
869.56-874.40: opportunities the more you reach for the
871.68-877.24: magnifying glass the bigger your excuses
874.40-879.08: become however if you pick the mirror
877.24-881.28: then you instead focus on the stuff you
879.08-883.64: can actually control your own thoughts
881.28-886.28: and actions so to embody the wisdom of
883.64-888.64: the Chinese proverb to be the person who
886.28-890.68: has already arrived at their destination
888.64-892.80: you need to pick up the mirror not the
890.68-896.36: magnifying glass the seventh thing to
892.80-899.04: avoid is staying static this is your
896.36-901.56: comfort zone where you Retreat seeking
899.04-904.32: in Safety and Security notice how there
901.56-907.08: are no gaps in this circle almost like a
904.32-909.36: self-imposed prison with no way out and
907.08-911.48: no way to grow if you're currently here
909.36-913.60: then you're not alone According to some
911.48-916.44: studies over half of Brits don't leave
913.60-918.84: their comfort zone and 45% of them are
916.44-921.00: worried that one day they might regret
918.84-923.44: it so what can you do to break out of
921.00-925.40: this prison well you need to expand the
923.44-927.20: circle this could be really difficult
925.40-929.24: when our minds are conditioned to avoid
927.20-931.52: taking risks but it's something I
929.24-933.68: learned at an early age let me show you
931.52-936.52: how I did it when I was younger my
933.68-938.52: comfort zone was narrow school studying
936.52-941.00: subjects I wasn't good at like maths and
938.52-942.96: English the traditional education system
941.00-945.24: didn't suit me I didn't want to be a
942.96-948.04: banker doctor or lawyer I wanted
945.24-950.08: something more Hands-On so I stepped out
948.04-952.24: of my comfort zone and pursued the
950.08-954.80: apprenticeship I mentioned earlier this
952.24-957.24: created a new space for me but I wasn't
954.80-959.16: satisfied yet I knew I needed more from
957.24-961.56: life so I started experimenting with
959.16-964.64: side hustles which pushed me further
961.56-967.36: into unfamiliar territory suddenly the
964.64-970.64: world was full of possibilities The Next
967.36-972.72: Step was clear starting my own business
970.64-975.52: this was a pivotal moment requiring a
972.72-978.36: big risk a bank load it was the best
975.52-980.60: decision that I ever made to expand my
978.36-982.56: Empire further I traveled to China in
980.60-985.00: search of a manufacturer for my own
982.56-987.16: brand of radio control models despite
985.00-990.00: The Language and Cultural barriers I
987.16-991.88: managed to build valuable connections I
990.00-994.52: ran my business for many years and
991.88-997.16: enjoyed success but eventually I felt
994.52-999.84: complacent my family was happy my bank
997.16-1003.20: was happy but my mind wasn't I wanted
999.84-1005.52: more so I expanded my comfort zone again
1003.20-1008.68: and started posting videos on YouTube at
1005.52-1010.88: the age of 53 I'd seen so many people on
1008.68-1013.68: YouTube faking it so I wanted to share
1010.88-1016.08: my knowledge and help others who like me
1013.68-1017.80: didn't fit the traditional path or those
1016.08-1019.84: who wanted to grow their wealth and feel
1017.80-1021.76: more secure in life remember you can
1019.84-1024.52: expand your comfort zone as much as you
1021.76-1026.60: want this space is infinite but you have
1024.52-1028.64: to claim it for yourself if you don't
1026.60-1030.80: push beyond your current boundaries
1028.64-1032.24: you'll miss out on all the possibilities
1030.80-1034.12: that could have been yours if you want
1032.24-1036.08: to learn what to do every time you get
